# Distributed Systems Project

## Part One 
Create a server which will hash passwords and also validate this password to ensure the hashing has 
been done correctly.
This project was created using IntelliJ IDEA application instead of Eclipse. I found while using this application, I ran into less errors when getting everything to compile. The version used was 2019.2.3 x64.
