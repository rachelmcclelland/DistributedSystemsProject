# Distributed Systems Project

## Part One 
Create a server which will hash passwords and also validate this password to ensure the hashing has 
been done correctly.
This project was created using IntelliJ IDEA application instead of Eclipse. I found while using this application, I ran into less errors when getting everything to compile. The version used was 2019.2.3 x64.

### Command Line Parameters
Port Number - 50551
If the wrong port number is entered, an error message saying incorrect port number will be displayed 
asking the user to try again
